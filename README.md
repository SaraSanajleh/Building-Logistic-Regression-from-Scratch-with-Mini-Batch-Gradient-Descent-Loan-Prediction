# Building Logistic Regression from Scratch with Mini Batch Gradient Descent Loan Prediction
This project focuses on building a Logistic Regression model from scratch using the Mini Batch Gradient Descent algorithm. The model is trained to predict loan approval status based on various applicant features. The project emphasizes understanding the fundamentals of Logistic Regression while implementing the algorithm without using pre-built libraries.
